# potential_vote
Perl scripts that parses DGEQ data and produces coloured Google Earth's KML maps of potential vote gains that can be made on every vote section by talking to the people (phone calls, door-to-door, distributing information, et caetera).

Quick start
-----------
Use cartes.pl to produce PotentielConversion.kml files that can be opened with Google Earth to see the coloured vote sections. The stronger the colour is, the stronger the vote gains through militantism are. Click on vote sections to get further data information. Use Google Earth to zoom and get additionnal geographic data of targeted vote sections.

A vote section is considered to have strong potential when there is a big number of sympathizers and a big number of people who don't vote. Such vote sections are the best targets for party militantism work.
